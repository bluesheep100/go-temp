This project is my first work using Go, and was a venture in utilizing a temperature sensor, (mcp9808) and a backlit LCD display connected to a BeagleBone Black over the i2c bus to measure the ambient temperature and display on the LCD.

In addition, the data is inserted into a [TimescaleDB](https://www.timescale.com) instance, represented as Kelvin, degrees Celsius, and degrees, Fahrenheit.
